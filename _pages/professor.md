## Professor

#### Eunjin Oh

I am an assistant professor at the
[Department of Computer Science and Engineering, POSTECH](
   https://cse.postech.ac.kr/
   ).
Before joining POSTECH, I was a postdoctoral fellow at
[Max Planck Institute for Informatics](
  https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/home
  ), hosted by
[Kurt Mehlhorn](
  https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~mehlhorn/
  ).
I completed my Ph.D. from POSTECH in 2018 under the supervision of
 [Prof. Hee-Kap Ahn](http://tcs.postech.ac.kr/).

My research interests lie in algorithms, data structures, and computational geometry. More specifically, I am interested in shortest path problems in simple polygons,
point location problems, and dynamic data structures for geometric objects.
